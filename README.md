# MusicAPI
Usecase for getting playlists via apple music api &amp; spotify api

This is a quick project using curlpp and jwt++ libriares to create JWT tokens for Apple music api by encrypting the token using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with the P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash algorithm. 

As well as doing an implicit grant to gain access to spoitfy endpoints.
